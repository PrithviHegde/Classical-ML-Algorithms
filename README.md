# Classical-ML-Algorithms
Implementation of various ML algorithms (Perceptron, FLD, Logistic Regression) on malignant tumors dataset. Done as a part of BITSF464 Machine Learning course.

This project consists of 4 parts, A, B, C, and a comparative study of the models implemented, in part D.
The dataset attempts to classify tumors into malignant or benign, based on 32 different parameters.

Part A: Perceptron

Implementation of a perceptron classifier, and finding out if the dataset is linearly seperable, and if so, to classify the normalised testing dataset based on the perceptron.


Part B: FLD

Implemetation of a Fischer's Linear Discriminant model on the 32-dimentional training data, and reduce it to a univariate problem, use it to find the gaussian boundary,
and classify testing data.


Part C: Logistic Regression

To build a Logistic Regression classification model on the dataset, and see how the testing accuracy changes when the decision probability threshold is varied. 

Part D: Comparing the above built models based on testing accuracy.
